        ACM IGDTUW in association with Prepbytes organized a complete bootcamp on competitive coding.
        The session was held on 19th February 2020 from 1 pm to 3 pm at the Seminar Hall IGDTUW.
        The keynote speaker was Mrs. Mamta Kumari, co-founder PrepBytes. She has 5+ years of working
        experience with tech giants like Amazon and Samsung. Students were taught the nitty-gritty of
        competitive coding and its importance in placement rounds for companies. After the session,
        the students felt ready to start their careers in the IT/Software field.
