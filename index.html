                I receive tremendous information on tools for ML and Social Media Platform APIs, like Python, Gephi, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Twitter REST API, etc, but was also introduced us to a new set of possibilities that included
                research as well as industry-based jobs in the field. Personally, the hands-on project in the end and having been introduced to Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) were major because of the amount of learning and the
                sense of purpose they gave me,thus changing my life."
