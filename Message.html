    <p>At IGDTUW, we always strive hard to expose our students to the real world problem-solving skills, and technical societies have been a driving engine in this endeavor to augment teaching-learning processes. 
        Through this annual report of 2020-21, I am very happy to know that ACM Student Chapter, the technical society at Department of Information Technology and one of the oldest technical societies of IGDTUW, continues to achieve our collective vision with flying colors.<br>
       The challenging times of Covid-19 did not let the motivation of the student chapter go down. They seamlessly transitioned from off-line student events to a plethora of online events: weekend knowledge sessions, online summer workshops and online Technical Weeks.
        The ACM student chapter became an unstoppable platform of celebrating learning.<br>
       While presiding over the inaugural function of the Summer Workshop of 2021 itself, I was happy to know that students would get an opportunity to preview state-of-the-art concepts in the field of machine learning and deep learning; and apply these concepts to solve challenging problems under the broad theme of ‘social good’. 
       Besides learning new technology principles, I am glad that it has oriented students towards leveraging their skills for the good of society. I was delighted to know that the expert speakers were invited from renowned academic institutions like MIT-IDSS, University of Cambridge, University of Washington, IIIT Hyderabad,
        IIT Kharagpur and industry experts from Samsung Research, Datapolis (Hungry).<br>
       The flagship Technical Week (termed as “Advaya” which means unique) saw a participation of 500+ students in the online sessions conducted each day in the week, with online Hackathons being organized to create an enthusiastic developer community for the IGDTUW students. Besides the technical week,
        the weekend online sessions have been conducted by senior IGDTUW students for their juniors to promote peer learning.<br>
       Covid-19 has thrown unimaginable challenges, and seeing the response of ACM Student Chapter, it gives me a great sense of satisfaction that students, who are our future generations of our nation, are all geared up to face all obstacles and succeed. I extend my heartiest congratulations to the
        “ACM Student Chapter @ IGDTUW” for making great strides and best wishes for their future endeavors.
        <br><br>
       Dr. (Mrs.) Amita Dev<br>

       <p>Extensive desk research during its pre-formative times, strong conceptualization leading to its formation on ground and now unarguably 
        on the road to becoming the most vibrant Student Society in the campus … “ACM Student Chapter @ IGDTUW” has indeed travelled a 
        long distance in a short span.<br>
        As a faculty advisor, it gives me immense pleasure to introduce the 2021 Annual Report of “ACM Student Chapter @ IGDTUW”, the Technical 
        Society of the Department of Information Technology at Indira Gandhi Institute of Technology.<br>
       An annual technical festival, four workshops over weekends, summer workshop, a technical week and more – it truly has been an eventful 
       journey with loads of learning and excitement. <br>
        Being the formative year, a lot of ground needed to be covered. Here, I must say that students in general and the core members (volunteers) 
        in particular worked in unison steadfastly with a determined resolve to bring the Chapter and its activities to light.  Student volunteers 
        worked tirelessly despite the extreme pressures of their academic schedules and contributed selflessly towards the Chapter – kudos to their grit,
         endurance and hard work.<br>
        I’d also like to express my gratitude to the respected Dr. Amita Dev, Hon’ble Vice Chancellor, IGDTUW for her constant motivation and encouragement. 
        Sincere thanks to the Head of Department, Dr. R. K. Singh for undertaking this initiative. Really appreciate the help coming from all the faculty members
        of the Department from time to time. With your guidance and enthusiasm of students, “ACM Student Chapter @ IGDTUW” will rise to greater heights.
       On behalf of Student Members of the Chapter …
